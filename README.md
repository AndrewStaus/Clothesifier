# C964 Computer Science Capstone: Clothesifier
The Computer Science Capstone is the final assignment before completing the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree program at Western Governors University.   It requires a student to use the skills they gained through the course of the degree to develop an application that utilizes a machine learning algorithm to solve a problem for a business.

Clothesifier is the application created for the fictitious e-commerce company Clothier, which allows a user to upload an image of a piece of clothing through a REST API and receive a category.
